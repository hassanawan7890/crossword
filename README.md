# 🧩 Crossword Builder & Solver  

A **React + TypeScript** web app that lets you design and solve your own crossword puzzles — powered by **Tau-Prolog** in the browser (with a pure JS fallback).  

Build, import, export, and auto-solve crosswords — right from your browser.

## 💡 Key Concepts  

- **Constraint satisfaction:** words must match at crossing letters.  
- **Logic programming:** Prolog enforces constraints declaratively.  
- **Fallback solving:** a JS MRV (Minimum Remaining Values) solver ensures it works even offline.
